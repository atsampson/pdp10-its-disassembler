BINARY IMAGE format:
  2 36-bit words in 9 8-bit bytes.

CORE DUMP format:
  The TM03 packs each 36-bit word into 5 consecutive tape frames.  The leftmost
  32 bits of the word are stored in the first 4 tape frames (ordered from left
  to right), and the remaining four bits are stored in the low half of the 5th
  tape frame.  The left half of the 5th bit is written as 0000 and treated as
  "don't care" data on read.

INDUSTRY/ASCII/ANSI COMPATIBLE format:
  See below.

EVACUATE format:
  ITS dump format.
